## Short presentation {.unnumbered}
#<div style="text-align: justify">
The Village Bandiagara II is part of the Zangasso commune in the Cercle of Koutiala in the Sikasso region of southern Mali. Basically, it is composed of desert and semi-desert areas, which has a well-defined climatic seasonality with a marked drought.

Some tribes live in the Village Bandiagara II, one of them is the Dogon of Bangadiara II. On February 15th, accompanied by a native of the tribe, we walked around the perimeter of the Dogon tribe's home in Bandiagara II, recording the route on a hiking line with GPS tracks using a Garmin Forerunner 235, such as illustrated in figure \@ref(fig:fig01a), in which the top part shows the route in the satellite layer, the left in the map layer and below the route in the elevation (m), these files were downloaded from Garmin Connect app. And, simultaneously, we recorded georeferenced photos using the Iphone 12 mini smartphone with the GPSMapCamera app installed (Illustration in figure \@ref(fig:fig01c)).

Using R software which is environment for statistical computing and graphics and R packages: dplyr [@R-Wickham2021dply], ggplot2 [@R-Wickham2020ggplot2], leaflet [@R-Cheng2021leaflet], leafpop [@R-Appelhans2021leafpop], lubridate [@R-Spinu2021lubridate], purrr [@R-Wickham2023purrr], readr [@R-Wickham2023readr], sf [@R-Pebesma2021sf], tibble [@R-Muller2022tibble], tidyr [@R-Wickham2020tidyr], and exifr [@R-Dunnington2021exifr], the databases of the georeferenced route and the geotagged photographs were joined and an interactive map created.

Georeferenced photographs have the potential to recognize in fieldwork by recording topographical information, land cover and land use, interactions between residents and the RN11 road, interactions between neighboring tribes, the use of building elements and their surroundings, and finally, exploring the potential to reveal areas of interest and their underlying spatio-temporal dynamics to improve the quality of health and sanitation.
