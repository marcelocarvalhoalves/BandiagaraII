Basically, it is composed of desert and semi-desert areas, which has a well-defined climatic seasonality with a marked drought.\r\nOn February 15th, we walked around the perimeter of the village, recording the route on a walking line with Garmin Forerunner 235 GPS measurements , and simultaneously recording geottaged photos using the Iphone 12 mini cell phone (Ilustration in figure 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Ilustration geotagged photo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing R and R packages: dplyr (Wickham, François, et al. 2022), ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2022), leaflet (Cheng et al. 2021), leafpop (Appelhans and Detsch 2021), lubridate (Spinu et al. 2021), purrr (Wickham, Henry, and RStudio 2023), readr (Wickham et al. 2023), sf (Pebesma et al. 2022), tibble (Müller et al. 2022), tidyr (Wickham and RStudio 2020), and exifr (Dunnington and Harvey 2021).\r\nThis walk is the delimitation of the georeferenced area, making it possible to recognize the place by recording topographic information, land cover and use, the interactions between the residents of the rail such and the neighboring tribes, understanding the use of construction elements and its surrounding environment and, therefore, exploring the potential to reveal interesting areas and their underlying space-time dynamics to improve the quality of health and sanitation.\r\nOpenStreetMap.France (https://www.openstreetmap.fr/) and EsriWorldImagery (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/data/data-portfolio/imagery)\r\nExplore the interactive surveying in the web:\r\nclick here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppelhans, Tim, and Florian Detsch. 2021. leafpop: Include Tables, Images and Graphs in Leaflet Pop-Ups. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leafpop/.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheng, Joe, Bhaskar Karambelkar, Yihui Xie, Hadley Wickham, Kenton Russell, Kent Johnson, Barret Schloerke, et al. 2021. leaflet: Create Interactive Web Maps with the JavaScript ’Leaflet’ Library. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/.\r\n\r\n\r\nDunnington, Dewey, and Phil Harvey. 2021. exifr: EXIF Image Data in R. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exifr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nMüller, Kirill, Hadley Wickham, Romain Francois, Jennifer Bryan, and RStudio. 2022. tibble: Simple Data Frames. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/.\r\n\r\n\r\nPebesma, Edzer, Roger Bivand, Etienne Racine, Michael Sumner, Ian Cook, Tim Keitt, Robin Lovelac, et al. 2022. sf: Simple Features for R. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpinu, Vitalie, Garrett Grolemund, Hadley Wickham, Davis Vaughan, Ian Lyttle, Imanuel Costigan, Jason Law, et al. 2021. lubridate: Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Winston Chang, Lionel Henry, Thomas Lin Pedersen, Kohske Takahashi, Claus Wilke, Kara Woo, Hiroaki Yutani, Dewey Dunnington, and RStudio. 2022. ggplot2: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Romain François, Lionel Henry, Kirill Müller, and RStudio. 2022. dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Lionel Henry, and RStudio. 2023. purrr: Functional Programming Tools. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Jim Hester, Romain Francois, Jennifer Bryan, Shelby Bearrows, PBC Posit, Jukka Jylänki, and Mikkel Jørgensen. 2023. readr: Read Rectangular Text Data. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, and RStudio. 2020. tidyr: Tidy Messy Data. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
