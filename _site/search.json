Basically, it is composed of desert and semidesert areas, which has a well-defined climatic seasonality with a marked drought.\r\nSome tribes live in the Bandiagara II Village, one of them is the Dogon of Bangadiara II. On February 15th, accompanied by a native of the tribe, we walked around the perimeter of the Dogon tribe’s home in Bandiagara II, recording the route on a hiking line with GPS tracks using a Garmin Forerunner 235 (https://www.garmin.com/pt-BR/p/529988), according to figure 1, in which the top part shows the route in the satellite layer, the left in the map layer and below the route in the elevation (m). These files were downloaded from Garmin Connect app (https://www.garmin.com/pt-BR/p/125677). Simultaneously, georeferenced photos were recorded using the Iphone 12 mini smartphone with the GPSMapCamera app (https://gpsmapcamera.com/) (See figure 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Route on a hiking line, top left in satellite layer, top right in satellite layer, and below the elevation map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Geotagged photograph illustration Bandiagara II Village central area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR software (https://www.r-project.org/) and R packages were used in this application. In general, packages: dplyr (Wickham, François, et al. 2022), ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2022), leaflet (Cheng et al. 2021), leafpop (Appelhans and Detsch 2021), lubridate (Spinu et al. 2021), purrr (Wickham, Henry, and RStudio 2023), readr (Wickham et al. 2023), sf (Pebesma et al. 2022), tibble (Müller et al. 2022), tidyr (Wickham and RStudio 2020), exifr (Dunnington and Harvey 2021), and anytime (Eddelbuettel 2020). R and Rstudio enabled data processing, analysis, and also the elaboration and dissemination of this project.\r\nThe databases of the georeferenced route and the geotagged photographs were joined, and an interactive map was created. The interactive map can be accessed over the OpenStreetMap.France world map layer (https://www.openstreetmap.fr/) or Esri.WorldImagery satellite imagery base map (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/imagery-remote-sensing/capabilities/content), as examples in the figures 3 and 4, respectively.\r\nGeoreferenced photographs have the potential to recognize in fieldwork the information about relief variation, land cover and land use, interactions between residents and the RN11 road, interactions between neighboring tribes, the use of building elements and their surroundings, and finally, exploring the potential to reveal areas of interest and their underlying spatio-temporal dynamics.\r\nThe expectation of this work is to increase people’s quality of life, with health and sanitation, and consequently increase the development of work in the field.\r\nExplore the interactive surveying in the web: click here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Interactive web mapping illustration over the OpenStreetMap.France layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Interactive web mapping illustration over the Esri.WorldImagery layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppelhans, Tim, and Florian Detsch. 2021. leafpop: Include Tables, Images and Graphs in Leaflet Pop-Ups. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leafpop/.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheng, Joe, Bhaskar Karambelkar, Yihui Xie, Hadley Wickham, Kenton Russell, Kent Johnson, Barret Schloerke, et al. 2021. leaflet: Create Interactive Web Maps with the JavaScript ’Leaflet’ Library. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/.\r\n\r\n\r\nDunnington, Dewey, and Phil Harvey. 2021. exifr: EXIF Image Data in R. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exifr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nEddelbuettel, Dirk. 2020. anytime: Anything to ’POSIXct’ or ’Date’ Converter. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/anytime/.\r\n\r\n\r\nMüller, Kirill, Hadley Wickham, Romain Francois, Jennifer Bryan, and RStudio. 2022. tibble: Simple Data Frames. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/.\r\n\r\n\r\nPebesma, Edzer, Roger Bivand, Etienne Racine, Michael Sumner, Ian Cook, Tim Keitt, Robin Lovelac, et al. 2022. sf: Simple Features for R. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpinu, Vitalie, Garrett Grolemund, Hadley Wickham, Davis Vaughan, Ian Lyttle, Imanuel Costigan, Jason Law, et al. 2021. lubridate: Make Dealing with Dates a Little Easier. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Winston Chang, Lionel Henry, Thomas Lin Pedersen, Kohske Takahashi, Claus Wilke, Kara Woo, Hiroaki Yutani, Dewey Dunnington, and RStudio. 2022. ggplot2: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Romain François, Lionel Henry, Kirill Müller, and RStudio. 2022. dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Lionel Henry, and RStudio. 2023. purrr: Functional Programming Tools. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, Jim Hester, Romain Francois, Jennifer Bryan, Shelby Bearrows, PBC Posit, Jukka Jylänki, and Mikkel Jørgensen. 2023. readr: Read Rectangular Text Data. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/.\r\n\r\n\r\nWickham, Hadley, and RStudio. 2020. tidyr: Tidy Messy Data. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
